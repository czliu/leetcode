/* 
This problem is essentially a problem of searching the shortest path of a graph, so the key to solving the problem is :

1. how to construct a graph that is as simple as possible.
2. traverse the nodes in the graph as few times as possible.
For problem 1, you can start from the starting point and build the association of nodes in the graph layer by layer based on the width search.
For problem 2, it is necessary to construct a reverse graph starting from the end point at the same time.

Then, the shortest path is searched based on the reverse graph to avoid traversing the paths that cannot reach the end point from the starting point.
